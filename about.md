I am a Software Engineer in the Customer Engineering team at Arista Networks, based out of Glasgow, Scotland. I'm presently working on developing software to support and manage large data centre deployments.

I graduated with an expedited masters degree in Theoretical Computer Science supported by the Undergraduate Excellence Scholarship from the University of Glasgow. I did research as a part of the Formal Analysis, Theory and Algorithms section for my dissertations, advised by Ciaran McCreesh and Gethin Norman focusing on combinatorial search and proof logging.
